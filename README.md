Accommodation Website project for ITSP200 - 2018

A student accomodaition website with full user and admin features.

The **learningspace** and **learningspaceadmin** folders contain templates for the final system (use these for an idea of what your solution should look like).

The **learningspacefinal** folder contains the database that you need to import to your MySQL server and the **AccSystem** folder, which must be put in your NetBeans project folder located in "C:\xammp\htdocs\".

The live chat system is external, so you need to add **allow_url_include = 1** to your php.ini file on your Apache server.
